# SvelteKit + GraphQL

Example project using SvelteKit with the [SpaceX GraphQL API](https://api.spacex.land/graphql/), deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

This uses the [Vercel Adapter](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/adapter-vercel) for SvelteKit.

```bash
npm run build
```
